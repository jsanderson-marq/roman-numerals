# If Corepack isn't installed yet
npm install -g corepack
# If Corepack isn't enabled yet
corepack enable
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run tests once
yarn test

# Watch tests
yarn test:watch

# Run tests with web UI
yarn test:ui

# Lint and format
yarn lint
yarn format

```
